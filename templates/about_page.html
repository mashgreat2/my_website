            Software Engineer with a hunger to learn and grow.
            Learning new things about software design always excites me.
            I want to learn and master programming skills that can be used to solve real life problems.
            I enjoy reading books and I am always looking to expand my understanding of important programming concepts and best practices.
            I want to keep learning and develop my understanding of various ideas in software architecture and web scalability.
            So far, my experience has been more about working with back-end technologies,
            but I do have interest in learning about front-end technologies.
          </p>
